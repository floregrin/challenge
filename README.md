We show how to extrapolate the survey data to predict the number of cases. We performed several analysis using ML \&amp; AI techniques on given states, countys and countrys. We pre-processed the data using Data Science techniques with Pandas, Numpy and csaps written in Python and processed the data using Neural Network codes written in Julia and ML techniques using Sklearn. Our work has potential application on the control of the number of cases using a new approach that combines the mobility of persons between different states and the optimization of flow matrices.
